#Upgrading to the Mozu Core 9 Theme

##HOW TO UPGRADE YOUR THEME
You can use the [Mozu Theme Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-mozu-theme) to update an existing theme to include changes in this version. You can also run the generator in an empty directory to clone these files as the basis for a brand new theme. 

When you run the Mozu Theme Generator, the tools create a git remote to the Mozu [core-theme](https://github.com/Mozu/core-theme/tree/master) repository. In the future, if you run the generator from your local theme directory, the tool will automatically check the Mozu Core theme for updates and offer to merge them for you.
